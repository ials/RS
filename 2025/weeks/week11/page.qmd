title: "🗓️ Unit 11 -  Texture feature extraction methods"
---

This week we will become familiar with the concept of image texture and the different texture metrics.


## 👨‍🏫 Lecture  

[Texture Is Important in Improving the Accuracy of Mapping Photovoltaic Power Plants](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/19/3909)

[Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix](https://medium.com/aimonks/gray-level-co-occurrence-matrix-glcm-a-comprehensive-analysis-a58bbc49c0f6)

## Practical exercise

- Create a Colab notebook

- Install [pyfeats](https://github.com/giakoumoglou/pyfeats)

- Read any multispectral image 

- Try extraction of different texture features 

- Write down your results & what you learned
